## Career History

### 2003-13 — Senior Managing Consultant for CRU Strategies

CRU Strategies is the consulting division of the group. He was involved in strategic advice for clients (particularly for market entry and product optimisation) as well as projects involving due diligence for financial transactions and feasibility studies, improved product/market strategies, competitive analysis, product value in use, and infrastructure assessment for mining and metals projects. His specialities have been steel, and ferrous raw materials (iron ore, coking coal and coke, DRI/HBI, and scrap). He has also managed projects on ferroalloys (nickel, chrome, molybdenum, manganese and silicon, vanadium), copper, and bauxite. Projects included managing and training project teams, and client liaison, as well as   marketing. He has acted as an expert witness for commercial dispute resolution.

### 1994-2003 — Director, Steel Business Unit, CRU International

Prior to transferring to CRU Strategies he created the steel business unit for CRU International (now CRU Analysis), leading a major expansion which established CRU as the leading independent supplier of market and cost services to the steel and ferrous raw material industries. This involved the creation of three teams for steel products, steelmaking raw materials, and special steels and ferroalloys, and a series of monthly market reports (Monitors), quarterly and longer term market and price forecasting services which included extensive price discovery, cost services, and multiclient and single client studies. During the period while he was in charge of steel, turnover of the business unit increased four fold and profits five fold.
